  "text": "The reply came later that night. \nCatalina sent them a data dump through a secure onion link—an archive of PDFs, emails, and ledger records tying various art sales to a crypto-exchange in the Seychelles. Hidden inside was a larger story: a politician laundering bribes through digital art, masking transactions as \"anonymous Bitcoin patrons.\"\nAnna was stunned. \nAs they dug deeper, they discovered the politician's campaign email—contact@unitedchange.org—and a personal Gmail, lance.morenopolitical@gmail.com. Tracing his aliases through purchase records, they connected his payments to Catalina's original whistleblowing work. \nThe final proof? A 6.4 BTC payment from Lance Moreno to an anonymized wallet now controlled by a silent partner—revealed in one of Catalina's leaked emails. \nAnna turned to Marcellus. \n\"This isn't just money laundering. This is state-level corruption.\"\n",
