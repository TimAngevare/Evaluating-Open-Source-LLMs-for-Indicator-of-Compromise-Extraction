  "text": "Catalina's encrypted backup revealed contact lists from her investigation. One entry stood out: a gallery owner in Brussels with phone number +32 2 555 1234. The owner had allegedly facilitated art sales to shell companies. His assistant could be reached at +32-477-55-6789 for verification. Both numbers were logged alongside a TOX identifier used for private negotiations: 56A1ADE4B65B86BCD51CC73E2CD4E542179F47959FE3E0E21B4B0ACDADE51855D34D34D37CB5. Cross-referencing with Belgian law enforcement databases showed the gallery had processed payments through a server at 78.141.205.18. Catalina's notes indicated she had spoken with the assistant multiple times before disappearing.",
